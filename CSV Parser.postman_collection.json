While the Washington Post review commented that the film was an \\\"all-too-easy target for ridicule\\\", it also mentioned one of the film's high points: \\\"In one scene, a typically droll Vermont resident (playing himself) sums up his state's fabled coolness to strangers by suggesting that a sign be placed at the state line, reading \\\"Welcome to Vermont.
